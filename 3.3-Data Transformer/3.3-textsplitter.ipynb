Code-mixed text combines words and phrases from\\ndifferent languages, making it challenging for traditional translation models. Our system uses\\nadvanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques to accurately detect and translate this\\nmixed language. By focusing on Marathi, which is widely spoken in India, we aim to meet the\\ngrowing need for effective translation tools in multilingual environments. Our goal is to\\ndevelop a reliable and efficient translation system that can be expanded to other Indic\\nlanguages, helping to overcome language barriers and improve communication in diverse\\nlinguistic settings.\\n\\uf06c Face Emotion Recognition\\nDeveloped a real-time emotion detection system utilizing a Convolutional Neural\\nNetwork (CNN) model. The system captures live video feed using a webcam and processes\\nthe input frames to detect facial expressions. It uses the OpenCV library to detect faces and pre\\nprocesses the the image data before feeding it into the trained CNN model. The model classifies\\nemotions into seven categories: angry, disgust, fear, happy, neutral, sad, and surprise.
